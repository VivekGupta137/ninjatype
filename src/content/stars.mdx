# ⭐ Star Rating System

As you practice typing with each finger, you'll earn stars based on your typing speed (WPM) and accuracy. The star system is designed to reward consistent improvement while maintaining good accuracy.

## How to Earn Stars

**Base Stars Calculation:**

Stars are earned based on your typing speed using a simple formula:

**Stars = WPM ÷ 2** (rounded down)

**Example:** If you type at 14 WPM, you earn 7 base stars (14 ÷ 2 = 7)

### Star Progression by WPM

- **1-10 WPM:** 0-5 stars
- **11-20 WPM:** 5-10 stars
- **21-30 WPM:** 10-15 stars
- **31-40 WPM:** 15-20 stars
- **41+ WPM:** 20+ stars

## Color Tiers

Your stars change color as you progress through different achievement levels. **5 stars are displayed at a time**, with the color indicating your tier:

### <span style="color: #ffffff;">⭐ White Stars</span>
**1-5 Stars**

Beginner level - You're just getting started!

### <span style="color: #10b981;">⭐ Green Stars</span>

## Accuracy Penalties

Maintaining high accuracy is crucial! Your final star count is reduced based on your accuracy:

| Accuracy Range | Star Penalty |
|----------------|--------------|
| 96-100% | No penalty ✅ |
| 86-95% | -1 star |
| 76-85% | -2 stars |
| 66-75% | -3 stars |
| 56-65% | -4 stars |
| 46-55% | -5 stars |
| 40-45% | -6 stars |
| Below 40% | No stars earned ❌ |

> **⚠️ Important:** If your accuracy falls below 40%, you won't earn any stars for that session, regardless of your WPM!

👀 **Don't look at the keyboard:** Try to rely on touch and muscle memory

⏱️ **Gradually increase speed:** As accuracy improves, naturally increase your typing pace

🎨 **Aim for color tier upgrades:** Each new color tier is a significant achievement!

💪 **One finger at a time:** Focus on mastering one finger before moving to the next

📊 **Track your progress:** Watch your stars increase as you improve
